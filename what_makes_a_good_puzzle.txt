My first attempt played like a multiple choice test, where the game play was highly linear and soley based on the graphics/dialogue the  game provided.

Part of a good text game is solving a puzzle. But that begs the question, what makes a good puzzle?
Here are some things I learned along the way.

# Mechanics
- Controls menu. Player interactability/interactive experience (UX design).
- 1,2,3,4
- call, hold
- matching pairs (scoring system)

Texas Hold E'm
Straight 1234
Use this card. (Gain card to use at any time)
- call or fold.(lose your card)
- on loss you lose a card.all

# Card Renderer

## Control Menu
